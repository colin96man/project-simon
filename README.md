# Viking Simon

This game is a viking themed version of the Simon toy that was originally released in 1978. The object of the game is to successfully memorize and copy the pattern of lights that the game shows. In this version of the game there are ten rounds. Each round will show a corresponding amount of lights, round one will show one button light up, round two will show the first button and then a second, round three will show the first button then the second and then a third and so on. After the game shows the buttons lighting up it is up to the player to push the buttons in the same exact order every round until they complete all ten rounds. If the player presses the wrong button when attempting to copy the game's pattern the game is over. Whenever a new game is started the game's pattern is randomized to keep things interesting!
